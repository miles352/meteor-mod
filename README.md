# jeff mod

## Features
- AFKBoostFly (Useless on current 2b anticheat)
  - Makes you look up and down to gain momentum.
- TrailFollower (Requires XaeroPlus)
  - Follows trails in all dimensions using either pitch40 or baritone. May break on path splits or other cases.
- Pitch40Util
  - Used alongside meteors pitch40. Auto sets min and max bounds so that you continue to gain height. Also has an auto firework mode for when you lose velocity.
- Search Area
  - Requires some other mod to make you move.
  - Spirals you or goes in a rectangle area by changing where you look.
- AutoJoinServer
  - Automatically joins a server when you launch minecraft.
- AutoLogY
  - Disconnects you if you go below a certain Y value.
- ChestIndex
  - Automatically opens chests in range and collects a list of every item inside. They can then be printed to the chat in different ways. You can also save them to a JSON file.
- FollowBaritonePath (WIP)
  -	Sort of works, but I would not recommend rn.
- GotoPosition
  - Looks at the position specified and holds w.
- HighlightOldLava
  - Highlights lava that is of a certain height. This used to be helpful for tracing paths in the nether but with new pallete newchunks its not really useful.
- LookAt
  - Kind of a joke module, it just locks your rotation to the nearest player.
- ChatCoordSpammer
  - Sends your position in chat every x seconds. Could be fun to see if people come kill you.
