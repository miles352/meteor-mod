## Features
- AFKBoostFly
  - Makes you look up and down to gain momentum.
- TrailFollower (WIP, Requires XaeroPlus)
  - Only works for 1.19+ chunk trails. Only the basic mode is implemented, it just tries to follow the trail in the same direction you were heading.
- Search Area
  - Requires some other mod to make you move.
  - Spirals you or goes in a rectangle area by changing where you look.
- AutoJoinServer (Possibly Broken)
	 - Automatically joins a server when you launch minecraft.
 - AutoLogY
	 - Disconnects you if you go below a certain Y value.
- ChestIndex
	- Automatically opens chests in range and collects a list of every item inside. They can then be printed to the chat in different ways.
- FollowBaritonePath (WIP)
	-	Sort of works, but I would not recommend rn.
- GotoPosition
	- Looks at the position specified and holds w.
- HighlightOldLava
	- Highlights lava that is of a certain height. This used to be helpful for tracing paths in the nether but with new pallete newchunks its not really useful.
- LookAt
	- Kind of a joke module, it just locks your rotation to the nearest player.
