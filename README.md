# jeff mod (For minecraft 1.21.1 and 1.21.4)
#### Make an issue or DM me on discord `0x658` with any questions
## Features
- GrimEfly (Credit to Divined for help with this)
  - Lets you fly with a chestplate on, which means you don't lose durability. An elytra is required in the hotbar.
  - Has a bounce mode with a baritone highway obstacle passer.
  - Bounce in 1x2 tunnels can reach up to 130bps. (Make sure to use ViaFabric 1.20.4 if having issues)
- AFKBoostFly (Useless on current 2b anticheat)
  - Makes you look up and down to gain momentum.
- TrailFollower (Requires XaeroPlus, Credit to WarriorLost for creating the original TrailFollower this was based off)
  - Follows trails in all dimensions using either pitch40 or baritone. May break on path splits or other cases.
- BetterStashFinder
  - Pretty much the same as meteors stash finder except some extra features:
    - It doesn't look for stashes in unloaded chunks
    - It can mark the stash finds on the Xaero Minimap
    - It can send stash hits to a discord webhook
- OldChunkNotifier
  - Sends a message to a discord webhook when old chunks are found.
- DiscordNotifs
  - Logs different things to a discord webhook.
- Pitch40Util
  - Used alongside meteors pitch40. Auto sets min and max bounds so that you continue to gain height. Also has an auto firework mode for when you lose velocity.
- NoJumpDelay
  - Surprisingly most clients don't have this, but why not have it on.
- GrimAirPlace
  - Meteor's airplace code but with a grim bypass.
- Search Area
  - Requires some other mod to make you move.
  - Spirals you or goes in a rectangle area by changing where you look.
- AutoLogY
  - Disconnects you if you go below a certain Y value.
- ChestIndex
  - Automatically opens chests in range and collects a list of every item inside. They can then be printed to the chat in different ways. You can also save them to a JSON file.
- GotoPosition
  - Looks at the position specified and holds w.
- HighlightOldLava
  - Highlights lava that is of a certain height. This used to be helpful for tracing paths in the nether but with new pallete newchunks its not really useful.
